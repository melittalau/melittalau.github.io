                <h2>Born from personal experience: Frustrations when planning rehearsals</h2>
                <p>
                    I love creating and performing theatre-pieces. I love the teamwork and the thrill of making the
                    audience laugh, cry and feel entertained. Shows are complex to plan and develop and require a lot of
                    organisational overhead, it can be challenging, even with an amazing team.
                    <br>When everybody involved is very passionate and invests much of their spare time, it can also
                    create conflict. Some people might drop out at the last minute before a rehearsal or not turn up
                    without notice. There can be too many channels used for communication and a lack of transparency on
                    the agenda. Such difficulties can have a great impact on everybodies motivation.
                    <br><br>
                    I wanted to find out, if other groups are faced with similar problems and create a solution.

                <p>
                    After running a survey, I found some of my frustrations where quite common, but there were also
                    other problems.

                            85% of people feel like they need to be better prepared for rehearsal and know what to
                            prepare exactly.

                <p>In the following interviews I wanted to know: Why are people not attending? How does that make you
                    feel? What are
                    the consequences for the group and the project? How do you prepare your rehearsal? How successful is
                    it?</p>
                <p>
                    The interviews revealed that most problems were more relevant for larger groups that don’t have a
                    supervisor and
                    organise themselves rather democratically. In these groups, the dynamics are much different, with
                    more focus on
                    personal commitment and relationships, which can a great impact on the individual motivation. <br>
                    It seemed, what might help groups overcome their challenges, is to have a clear, shared goal. It
                    also appeared
                    an increate in transparency can reduce friction.

                <p>The focus was on three topic:</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            How might we create more transparency about who is attending?
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>How might we keep up the motivation & commitment?</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            How might we create an easy overview on all relevant information to keep everyone on the

                <p>
                    When digging into why people are not attending, I found that in 3/4 of all cases, their work, school
                    projects or illness get in the way. Life happens and some things can not be prevented. So I made it
                    my commitment to keep members on track with what is happening in the group when they can not attend
                    and to give them a chance to still contribute to the projects.
                    <br><br>
                    I soon found that, due to their busy lives, Naomi, Julie and Phil most likely need a solution on
                    their phone, for when they are on the train, at break of work or uni or at rehearsal. The product
                    would be an app.

                    They say: “Fail fast!”, so I created a paper prototype to test the ideas and the userflow for the
                    persona Julie.
                    <br><br>
                    The task was to sign off from the upcoming rehearsal, find out what you will be missing and then add
                    feedback to rehearsal from last week. 
                    <br><br>
                    After testing I translated my observations and findings into a digital low-fidelity prototype and
                    repeated the usertest using the ‘Marvel’-App. It provided a great chance to see how users would
                    interact with their phonesand helped optimise the usability early on, and finding the correct size
                    for fonts, buttons and other elements.

                    Turning my attention to branding, the first challenge was to find a suitable, available name for the
                    brand. I asked my piers to vote from a selection of ideas and with an overwhelming majority,
                    “Prepio” was chosen as a name for the product.
                    <br><br>
                    I wanted to create a brand that is fun and encouraging but at the same time conveyed a feeling of
                    transparency and organisation.

                    The text in the app had to be easily readable, so I opted for Inter for paragraphs and the playful,
                    more organic Livvic for headlines. For the colour-palettes, the blue palette provided a versatile
                    foundation with a clean and organised feel to it, while red and green tones add a more lively touch.

                    When creating the final designs, I found myself going back to my personas and their problems
                    constantly. Would this help them? Would they want to use this app to begin with? 
                    <br>A last usertest with one of my interview-partners, helped add some last minute tweaks to the
                    prototype and the overall positive resonance reassured me in my mission.

                    The MVP I created serves as a solid foundation with lots of potential to add more features to it.
                    The next steps would be to develop and test the administrator’s perspective, adding a flow for the
                    onboarding process and adding a desktop-version.
                    <br><br>
                    This project was a great opportunity to put my knowledge to the test and practise all the methods I
                    learned at the Ironhack UX/UI Bootcamp.
