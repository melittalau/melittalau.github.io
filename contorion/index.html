                <p>

At Contorion, we understand their needs for reliable, high quality products, best value for price and speedy delivery.

                <h2>Search Flyout</h2>
                <p>
                    I worked on an iteration for Contorion’s search flyout, that aimed to improve the interface design as well as the quality of search result suggestions. From heatmap tracking, I learned that the existing flyout had some elements customers didn’t interact with, because they were not helpful or difficult to understand. In an effort to reduce the cognitive load, I removed any unnecessary components and instead added relevant information to product suggestions, that would help customers make better decisions. The redesign was then set up for an A/B test.

                <h2>Product Widget</h2>
                <p>
                    As our team was building a design system and collecting all product widget elements, we noticed there were a lot of different versions that had accumulated over the past years all over the shop. To create consistency for both the customer and also our team, we decided to test the performance of different elements on the widget to measure their impact on CTR and CR. From the results, we created a unified design which was better readable and had all information critical for our customers’ purchasing decisions at one glance.

                <h2>Mobile Category Filters on Search Result Page</h2>
                <p>
                    A heuristic evaluation I conducted revealed possible usability issues on our search result page. These suggestions could be matched with data from our heatmap and customer feedback we had collected over the last year.
                    I focused my attention on product-filters, which can be a powerful tool to quickly narrow down large lists of search results from Contorion’s thousands of products and can save customers lots of time and frustrations. Out of the many suggestions to improve the search result page, the Discovery Team identified the mobile view as the most pressing issue and improved the filters from the ground up. Our usertest revealed that the new version cut time-on-task in half and improved the overall satisfaction with the process by 10%. In all tasks given to users, we saw great improvements in the task-success-rate. We also learned about their preferences in an additional short questionnaire.

                <h2>No Result Page</h2>
                <p>
                    From former user interviews we had learned that our no-result-page does not provide customers with the help and guidance they need. It left them rather frustrated and confused. Baymard’s guidelines provided us with a list of acceptance criteria for a new design.
                    On the new page, we remove any confusing elements and give customers more options to navigate from here. Now the experience doesn’t feel like a failure from the customer’s side. Instead it conveys that Contorion might not be able to provide what users are looking for but has a lot of alternative solutions to offer. The page now offers personalised product recommendations and an overview of all categories to provide another path of searching for the right product. Additionally, we offer B2B customers to contact their personal sales-agent at Contorion to support them with finding alternative products or make special orders.
